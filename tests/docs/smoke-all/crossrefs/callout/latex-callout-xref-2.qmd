## Cross-referenceable callouts in v1.4

In Quarto v1.4, you can cross-reference callouts.

::: {#not-2 .callout-note appearance="simple"}

In Quarto v1.4, you can cross-reference callouts with no titles.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}

Old-style callouts with no titles get the old treatment.

Like we mentioned in @not-1 and @not-2, you can cross-reference callouts.
